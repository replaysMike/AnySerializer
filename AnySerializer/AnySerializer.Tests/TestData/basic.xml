    Thank you f or sending us the information on <emphasis>SDL Trados Studio 2009</emphasis>.

    We like your products and think they certainly represent the most powerful translation solution on the market.

    We especially like the <component translate="yes">XML Parser rules</component> options in the <component translate="no">XML</component> filter.

    It has helped us to set up support for our XML files in a flash.

    We have already downloaded the latest version from your Customer Center.
